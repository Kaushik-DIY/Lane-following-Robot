# Tasks


## Road Following Algorithm Development

- **Algorithmic Foundation:** The core of your task is to develop an algorithm that enables a simulated robot to follow a designated path. You may opt for various approaches such as sensor-based line following, computer vision techniques, or even basic AI algorithms.

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilize the simulated vision sensors in CoppeliaSim to detect the path.

- **Control Logic:** Develop the control logic that translates sensor input into motor commands.
This could involve simple steering mechanisms or more complex control systems like PID controllers.

- **Programming:** Write your algorithm in Python, ensuring it interfaces effectively with CoppeliaSim through the Remote API. Focus on writing clean, well-documented code for ease of understanding and modification.
Key Concepts and Approaches:

    - **Computer Vision:** Explore image processing techniques like color detection, edge detection, or even neural networks for more advanced implementations.

    - **Proportional Control:** For simpler paths, a proportional controller might suffice to adjust the robot's steering based on the deviation from the path.

    - **Debugging and Iteration:** Regularly test your algorithm in the simulation. Be prepared to iterate and debug based on the robotâ€™s performance.

## Task 1

**Get robot handles, capture image and process the image**

- Implement the **get_handles** method to retrieve handles for robot components (left motor, right motor, camera) using CoppeliaSim's API. 

- Implement **get_image** method to capture RGB image from the camera, grayscale and threshold it. Return the thresholded image.

- Implement **process_image** method to process the image to find the centroid of the road.


## Task 2

**Steering the robot**

- Implement the **handle_camera** method to read the image from camera, process the image and steer the robot accordingly.

- Implement the **calculate_steering_angle** method to compute the steering angle based on the deviation of the road centroid from the image center.  

- Implement the **steer** method to adjust the robot's left and right motor speeds based on the calculated steering angle. 

- Implement the **set_wheels_speed** method. Control the speed of the robot's left and right motors by interfacing with CoppeliaSim's API.

- Implement the **stop** method. Stop the robot by setting motor speeds to zero.
